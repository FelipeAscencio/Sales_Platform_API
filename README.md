# Sales Platform API

## Introduction

In this group project, carried out within the framework of the University of Buenos Aires, we developed an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a REST API aimed at an online sales platform.

For its implementation, we used a set of modern technologies, including:
- REST API as the backbone of the system.
- Endpoints tested and documented using POSTMAN.
- Authorization and authentication systems based on standards such as OAuth and JWT.
- MySQL databases, managed through an ORM to simplify data persistence interactions.
- Spring Boot framework and Java as the core of the application.

In addition, we adopted agile methodologies to organize and optimize teamwork, adhering to the Scrum framework. To support this, we utilized the tool JIRA, which enabled us to effectively plan, prioritize, and track tasks, ensuring a smooth workflow and the achievement of high-quality results.

This approach allowed us to design a robust, scalable system aligned with the best practices in modern software development.

This platform contains both the tracking of weekly work across the 5 sprints and additional documentation.

## How to run the application for the first time

```
docker compose up --build
pnpm run dev
```

(To run it in subsequent instances, it is possible to omit the `--build`)
